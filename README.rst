fpvgcc
======

``fpvgcc`` is a python script/package to help analyse code footprint on
embedded microcontrollers using GCC generated Map files.

This module uses information contained within ``.map`` files generated by
gcc (when invoked with ``-Wl,-Map,out.map``), to provide easily
readable summaries of static memory usage at various levels of the code
hierarchy. This package generates no information that isn't already contained
within the ``.map`` file.

The provided outputs can be used to gain insight into the relative sizes of
included code, and aid in prioritizing static memory optimization for very
low memory platforms. Some provided functionality may also deliver minor
usability improvements to the workflow involved in parsing though generated
assembly listings.


.. warning::
    This package does not attempt to perform any kind of dynamic analysis.
    All memory usage reported refers only to **static** memory usage. This
    means the size of actual functions and global variables which are
    instantiated in the C code itself.

    Anything on the call stack, such as function locals, will **not** be
    accounted for. Similarly, anything in the heap which is allocated at
    runtime using ``malloc`` or similar will **not** be accounted for.

    Due to this, the utility of this module is likely limited to code
    written for highly memory constrained embedded microcontrollers, where
    dynamic memory allocation is anyway avoided when possible.


Known Issues
------------

This script was first written based on the format of mapfiles
generated by ``msp430-elf-gcc, v4.9.1``. Over time, it was modifed to
accept elements found in mapfiles generated by later versions and gcc-based
toolchains for other platforms.

Still, remember that the file parsing was implemented by observing the
content of real mapfiles, and not based on a file format specification.
Even with toolchains it was written to support, there are large sections
of the file that are not actually used. Due to this, the outputs generated
are not always accurate. Various boundary conditions result in minor errors
in size reporting.

The following more serious issues are known. They should be fixed at some
point, but for the moment I've chosen to work around them :

    - Having two C filenames with the same name (or generating the same
      obj name) in your tree will cause parsing to break on some
      platforms / toolchains.
